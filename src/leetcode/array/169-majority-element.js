 * You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

/**
 * Approach 2 Hash Map
 *
 * Time complexity : O(n)
 * We iterate over arr once and make a constant time HashMap insertion on each iteration.
 * Therefore, the algorithm runs in O(n) time.
 *
 * Space complexity : O(n)
 * At most, the HashMap can contain n - n/2 associations, so it occupies O(n) space.
 * This is because an arbitrary array of length n can contain n distinct values,
 * but arr is guaranteed to contain a majority element, which will occupy (at minimum) n/2 + 1 array indices.

/**
 * Approach 3 Sorting
 *
 * Intuition
 * If the elements are sorted in monotonically increasing (or decreasing) order,
 * the majority element can be found at index n/2 or n/2 + 1 incidentally, if n is even.
 *
 * Time complexity : O(nlgn)
 * Sorting the array costs O(nlgn) time in Python and Java, so it dominates the overall runtime.
 *
 * Space complexity : O(1) or O(n)
 * We sorted arr in place here - if that is not allowed, then we must spend linear additional space on a copy of nums and sort the copy instead.

/**
 * Approach 6 Boyer-Moore Voting algorithm
 *
 * Intuition
 * If we had some way of counting instances of the majority element as +1 and
 * instances of any other element as −1,
 * summing them would make it obvious that the majority element is indeed the majority element.
 * To do this, we maintain a count, which is incremented
 * whenever we see an instance of our current candidate for majority element
 * and decremented whenever we see anything else.
 * Whenever count equals 0, we effectively forget about everything in nums up to the current index
 * and consider the current number as the candidate for majority element.
 *
 * Time complexity : O(n)
 * Boyer-Moore performs constant work exactly n times, so the algorithm runs in linear time.
 *
 * Space complexity : O(1)
 * Boyer-Moore allocates only constant additional memory.
