Leetcode
15 3Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c
in nums such that a + b + c = 0?
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

Interview Questions: Analysis of Algorithm
3-SUM in quadratic time. Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes
time proportional to n^2
in the worst case. You may assume that you can sort the n integers
in time proportional to n^2n or better.

Note: these interview questions are ungraded and purely for your own enrichment.
