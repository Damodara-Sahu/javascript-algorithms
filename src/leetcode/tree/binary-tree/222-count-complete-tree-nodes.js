222 Count complete Tree Nodes
medium

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:
Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last,
is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as
possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:
Input:
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

Approach

The height of a binary tree is the largest number of edges in a path from the root
node to a leaf node. Essentially, it is the height of the root node.
Note that if a tree has only one node, then that node is at the same time the
root node and the only leaf node, so the height of the tree is 0.

Algorithm
1 A fully completed tree has node number: count = 2 ^ depth - 1
for example: [1,2,3]
depth is 2
count = 2 ^ 2 - 1 = 3

2 Compare left height and right height, if equal, use the formula,
otherwise recursively search left and right at next level

3 The search pattern is very similar to binary search, the difference of heights
either exists in left side, or right side

For those who are confused with (1 << leftDepth) - 1;
This is done to find the nodes when depth is known.
Suppose there are N nodes in a tree, then depth = (log2(n+1))
1 node gives log2(2) = 1
3 nodes gives log2(4) = 2
7 nodes gives log2(8) = 3
15 nodes gives log2(16) = 4
what we are doing in this line (1 << leftDepth) - 1 is given Depth we will find
Number of nodes,
N = 2 ^ depth - 1.

Complexity analysis
time complexity is O(log(n)^2)
if you draw the recursion tree and you will find that in every level,
there will always be one left or right subtree is a complete tree and will
just return. So every level's time is O(log n),
total time complexity is O(log(n) ^ 2)

Find a duplicate Number

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1
and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist.
Assume that there is only one duplicate number,
find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

Note:
1 You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2 You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3 Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
4 There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more
than once.
