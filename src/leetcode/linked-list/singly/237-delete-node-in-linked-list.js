237 Delete a node in Linked List
easy

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list,
given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9],
which looks like following: 4->5->1->9

Example 1:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should
become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

Example 2:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should
become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

Note:
The linked list will have at least two elements.
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the
linked list.
Do not return anything from your function.

/*
Approach swap with next node

The usual way of deleting a node node from a linked list
is to modify the next pointer of the node before it,
to point to the node after it:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> x
we want to delete 3 : 2.next = 4

Since we do not have access to the node before the one we want to delete,
we cannot modify the next pointer of that node in any way.
Instead, we have to replace the value of the node we want
to delete with the value in the node after it,
and then delete the node after it.

// todo provide pictures

Because we know that the node we want to delete
is not the tail of the list, we can guarantee that
this approach is possible.

Time and space complexity are both O(1).

/*
Usual way of deleting a node in Linked list: find a prev node

We are given the head of a linked list and a key. We have to delete the node
that contains this given key.

Hint:
keep track of prev pointer

Solution Breakdown
First, we have to find the key in the linked list. Weâ€™ll keep two pointers,
current and previous, as we iterate the linked list.

If the key is found in the linked list, then the current pointer would be
pointing to the node containing the key to be deleted. The previous should be
pointing to the node before the key node.

This can be done in a linear scan and we can simply update current and previous
pointers as we iterate through the linked list.

To delete a node from linked list, we need to do following steps.
1) Find previous node of the node to be deleted.
2) Change the next of previous node.
3) Free memory for the node to be deleted.

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> x
need to remove 3

Time is O(n)
space is O(1)
