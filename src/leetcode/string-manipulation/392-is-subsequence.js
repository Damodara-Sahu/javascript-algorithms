392 Is subsequence
easy

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed
from the original string by deleting some (can be none)
of the characters without disturbing the relative positions
of the remaining characters.
(ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B,
and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence.
In this scenario, how would you change your code?

/*
Approach 2 pointers

We will take two pointer for both strings:

1 i is pointer for s and j pointer for t
2 compare character of s and t at i and j index rep.
- if both same then increment both pointer i and j
- else just increment t pointer j
3 repeat step 2 until either pointer reach the last character of the string
4 check if ith pointer reach to the end of s string return i == s.length()

time is O(n)
space is O(1)

/*
Approach recursive

time complexity is O(n), where n is length of t, because in worst case,
if s is not subsequence of t, you will loop through entire t string.

About space complexity, we need to remember, that
recursive algorithms take at least O(n) space where n is the depth of the recursive call.
In our worst case it would be O(n)
