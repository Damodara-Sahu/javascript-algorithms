130 Surrounded regions
medium

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions
surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example:
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X

After running your function, the board should be:
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

Explanation:
Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O'
on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border
will be flipped to 'X'.
Two cells are connected if they are adjacent
cells connected horizontally or vertically.

/*
Approach

Explanation:
Capture all surrounded O-regions and flip finding regions in 4 directions by X
(marking + flipping)

// last row is not surrounded
// except regions lies on boundary

// turn x to 0?
// union find?

Leetcode
15 3Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c
in nums such that a + b + c = 0?
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
