/**
 * Selection sort works by selecting the minimum value in a list and
 * swapping it with the first value in the list.
 * It then starts at the second position, selects the smallest value in the remaining list,
 * and swaps it with the second element.
 * It continues iterating through the list and swapping elements until
 * it reaches the end of the list.
 * Now the list is sorted.
 * Selection sort has quadratic time complexity in all cases.
