recursion approach
update readme
check anki card


237 provide pictures
write a linked list ds and provide usual way of deleting with delete a node
provide test

226 invert
second approach: iterative
breadth first search definition queue
depth first search - stack

1 two sum
one pass hash table
2 pass hash table
2-pass approach can only implement with map?
update a readme and Hash component
google youtube
solution with map
check solution it's an open
put solution to leetcode

2 sum input arr sorted: move to separate task, create a test
binary search
2 pointers
test on leetcode

follow up design two sum data structure

check desc again, more clear why it's O(1)
provide all  tests

and left a comment = override simply works
use arr and hash https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/discuss/436771/JavaScript-Array-of-values-and-Map-of-values-and-locations-in-array

quick find
create anki: describe api, complexity
add to readme

//
quick union: check implementation
add a readme
an implementation of WeightedUnionFind: I think it's an error on medium with this.find
what is compression about?

check Here is a full js implementation, taken partly from Michael Toth’s JS visualisation of percolation through union find. I added compression, which Michael did not implement. I also changed the naming so it’s easier to read.

// bitwise
x>>y
dividing by 2
tilda x - complement  1 for 0, 0 for 1 the same as -x-1

0.4 useful combine bit operation
for operations that handle each bit, we first need a mask
that only set that bit to 1 and all others to 0,
this can be implemnted with arithemtic left shift sign
bu shifting 1 with 0 to n-1 steps  for n bitwise
mask = 1 << i
why 1 << 0 = 1????
0 << 1 = 0
1 << 1 = 2
0 << 0

2 & 1 - check operator and - is it check only last bit?

get ith Bit - what does it mean
move getBit
