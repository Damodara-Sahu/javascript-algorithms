# Computer Science in JavaScript
The repo contains JavaScript implementations of different famous computer science algorithms.

## Description
Collection of classic computer science paradigms, algorithms, and approaches written in JavaScript.
As well contains description and characteristics: runtime or complexity.
Without using in-built methods of JavaScript, for example, sort(), reverse() and etc.
Solutions include as well measuring of time complexity.

## Demo
Hosted on GitHub Pages, [Demo](https://julia-dizhak.github.io/javascript-algorithms/)

## Development
Technology
[ES6](http://es6-features.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with a syntax highlighter [Highlightjs](https://highlightjs.org/).

Tests run by `npm test`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Folder structure
The most recent packages are found in these directories:

* `src/algorithms` - the implementation source code
* `src/algorithms/***.spec.js` - tests for the implementation source code


### TODO:
  * scrollTo works with bug
  * details toggle works with bug (sometimes)
  * display level: beginner, medium, ... (like corners)
  * generate test coverage
  * performance test
